						<p style="color:#000;">The animation is magic. Yes, the animation is more than just creating interesting illusions, and at The Jigsaw we put all of our efforts and creativity to take animation at a new level. We strongly believe that
							there are new ways to visualize the universe and put them into the animation world to share.</p>

						<p style="color:#000;">
							We specializing in character animation, technical animation, medical animation, commercial animation, product visualization, 3D architectural walkthrough, and business animation. </p>

						<p style="color:#000;">Deep within The Jigsaw has a desire to invent, create, and tell stories in such a way to bring that particular animation story to life.</p>

						<p style="color:#000;">The Jigsaw is an animation and production company operating out of studios all over India. We have experience in animation techniques ranging from old traditional 2D animation to new 3D animation to stop motions and
							many more. We design the project that our client visualize and always brings something new and interesting for them.</p>
<h2>Animation Studio In India 2021</h2>
						<p style="color:#000;"> In India the pioneers of <a class="text-primary" href="https://videoexplainermumbai.in/"> animation studios</a> have been The Nation Films Division of India. They started India’s first dedicated animation studio in
							the year 1957 with the production of The Banyan Deer. This studio located in Mumbai heralded the era of animation for the country. </p>

						<p style="color:#000;"> The film was made by the Films Division of India and Veteran animators Bhimsain& Ram Mohan were instrumental in making the film. For this they were trained by Clair Weeks and started their career in Film Division’s
							Cartoon Unit.</p>

						<p style="color:#000;"> When Clair weeks came to India for this project, he had spend over 16 years in Disney Studios and was credited in the making of classics like Snow White, Cinderella and Bambi.</p>

						<p style="color:#000;"> The first Indian animation film made in a proper animation studio process was The Banyan Deer made in 1957.</p>

						<img class="img-fluid" src="https://thejigsaw.in/assets/images/new/Banyan-Deer.jpg" alt="">

						<p style="color:#000;"> So <strong>India’s first animation studio </strong> was Film Divisions Cartoon Unit that heralded and new era of animation production in India. Till day India’s <strong>pioneer Animation studio </strong>has made over 75 films. </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="https://thejigsaw.in/assets/images/new/cartoon-film-unit.jpg" alt="">

<<strong>NFDC animation film, The Tree of Unity</strong>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDUq13v6h-A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						<p> While the world over <strong> animation studios </strong> were starting to take shape, in India the initial trend was mainly an attempt by some acclaimed film makers to animated their title tracks or create short animation sequences.</p>

						<p> If we talk of individual efforts then In India this was pioneered by none other than Dada Saheb. His 1912 short The Growth of a Pea Plant introduced the concept of time-lapse photography, with one frame shot per day.In 1915 he
							produced the animated short AgkadyanchiMouj (Matchsticks' Fun). He had probably been inspired by Émile Cohl’s matchstick film. Unfortunately, animated works such as AgkadyanchiMouj and Vichitra Shilpa have not survived the ravages of
							time.</p>

						<p> Although NFDC (National Films Division Corporation) has been a pioneering animation studio in India, today a lot of animation studios have come up that work not only on national but also international projects.</p>

						<p> While earlier most of the animation series shown on Indian channels were mainly produced by international companies like Disney. Shows like Duck Tales and the ever green Tom and Jerry show, were quite popular in India. But with
							changing times Indian studios started to focus on Indian character and Indian stories. Some of the most successful animation series made by <strong>Indian Animation Studios </strong>include
							The Indian animation industry is divided into studios that mainly work for animation sector and studios that focus on the corporate sector and mainly produce video explainers explaining products and services and ads. Amongst the leading
							studios catering to the entertainment sector we have companies like Cosmos-Maya, Green Gold Animation, Toonz Animation and Digitoonz Media. These Indian Animation studios have been instrumental in making the Indian foray and have
							properties like Bapu, Guddu, Gadget Guru Ganesha, ChootaBhim and the latest series Dabangg (which is a offtake from the movie by the same name).</p>

						<h2> International History of Animation Studios and illustration </h2>
						<p> Illustrations have been used by human beings since time immemorial to convey incidents, stories and thoughts. And animation can often be thought of as a series of illustrations that are able to send a message as series of images.
							While today with the presence of high end computers and animation studios, animation has become relatively easy. This was not the case always. But I digress, let us continue with the story of animation. This use of sequence of images
							dates back to ancient Indians, Egyptians, Greeks and romans. After the invention of the printing press the same illustrations could be mass printed and took the form of cartoons and comics. One of the oldest comic book printed was in
							Japan in the year 1755. It was published by KoikawaHarumachi and named 'Kinkin sensei eiga no yume' (Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream). It was a story about a poor, low-ranked samurai who travels from the Japanese countryside to
							Tokyo to find a better job. </p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="https://thejigsaw.in/assets/images/new/animation-on-text.jpg" alt="">
						<p>From comics to film animation took another 133 years, when the first true animation films was showcased by <strong> <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-%C3%89mile_Reynaud">Charles-Émile Reynaud.</a> </strong> His Pantomimes Lumineuses series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames, that were
							manipulated back and forth to give an effect of continuous motion.</p>
						<p> Between 1895 and 1920, during the rise of the cinematic industry, various animation techniques were developed, including stop-motion with objects, puppets, clay or cutouts, and drawn or painted animation. Hand-drawn animation, mostly
							animation painted on cels, was the dominant technique throughout most of the 20th century and became known as traditional animation.</p>


						<p>The first 2D animation ever made was called Fantasmagorie, which was made by Emile Cohl. The black and white cartoon begins with Emile drawing a simple stick man in live action.The cartoon is about 75 seconds long and it took about 700
							different drawings to create. This historic animation was released in 1908. </p>
						<p> This time also saw the start of the animation studios. The first animation studio in the world was founded by Raoul Barré and his studio, Barré Studio in the year 1914. Although some sources say that the credit for this should go to
							rival Bray Productions. </p>

						<p> The earliest animation practices adopted by these animation studios was the use of mechanical perforation of cells and animating special effects on glass.</p>

						<p> And the first use of the animation techniques was for making animated advertisement movies. </p>

						<p> The use of 3D animation came on much later and the initial 3D animated video were made using stop motion or clay motion. This was done by using real life elements like toys, miniatures and similar elements and shotting the videos by
							moving them bit by bit. This created the illusion of motion. This style of animation was used quite a lot by Aardman Animations. They are a well renown animation studio, that is specifically know for the work that they have done in stop
							motion animation. They have made series like Gumby, Shawn The Sheep and Wallace and Gromit.
						</p>
						<p> One of the most famous company that made the worlds first all-CGI movie is Pixar Animation Studios. Founded in 1986, they created Toy Story in 1995 and they have made a more than 20 full movies to date. </p>



						<h3> Types of Animation</h3>


						<p> Animation is available in various flavors. There is 2D animation, 3d animation, whiteboard, motion graphics and so on. The kind of animation made depends to quite some extent on the target customer.</p>

						<p> For example, motion graphics animation is mainly used by animation studios to make animations like video explainers and this is used to explain the product and services. With the rapid growth in the dissemination mediums like the
							social media, video explainers are much in demand. </p>



						<h3> 2D Animation</h3>

						<p> 2D animation studios mainly work with software like Adobe Animate or Adobe After Effects (among others) is usually used when a story has to be told. This could be used by the animation studios which have clients in the entertainment
							sector and also by companies which target the corporate sector. Theanimation companies targeting the entertainment sector would mostly make 2D animation series that has main viewers who are children.On the other hand 2D animation made
							by the studios that target the corporate sector would make stand alone videos (they may make a series of videos too, but this is not normally the norm) that try to convey some information about a product, service or even a campaign.
							This is used to convey information in a simple easy to understand format. </p>

						<p> You can check this article as it has an overview of the 2D animation process adopted by studios</p>
						<p>Check out the <strong> <a class="text-primary" href="http://multimediamcc.com/old-students/ashaver/2d_process.html"> 2D animation process</a></strong></p>


						<h3> 3D Animation </h3>

						<p> 3D animation studios mainly work using software like Blender, 3D Max or Maya. It can also be used to convey stories, make entertaining films, describe the working of machinery or process and so on. </p>
						<p> In 3D animation computer made objects are able to move in 3D space. They can move and rotate like a real life 3D object. </p>

						<h3> 2D animation VS 3D animation </h3>

						<p> The look and feel of 2D and 3D animation is quite different. If you look at main stream movies, some of the examples of 2D animation are movies like Cinderella,The Lion King (1994), Mulan (1998) and the Little Mermaid are few examples
							of 2D animation. While these 2D movies have been made using computers, some of the 2D animation movies of the older era like One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) and Alice in Wonderland (1951) were made using classic cell animation
							techniques where each subsequentframe was drawn by hand to create the illusion of motion. </p>
						<p> On the other hand movies like , while Minions,Incredibles 2, Finding Doryand Frozen are examples of 3D animation. </p>
						<p> The main difference between 2D and 3D animation is that in 2D animations elements can only be moved on the X axis or horizontally, to simulate forward or backward movements and on the Y axis vertically (on the Y axis) if we want them
							to
							move up or down. </p>
						<p> In 3D animations objects can also be moved along the Z axis and the person sees it closer or further away.</p>
						<p> To put it simply, 3D animation involves three dimensions X,Y and Z, while a 2D animation has only two dimensions X and Y. </p>
						<p>The objects in a 2D animation are merely flat, such as a picture or a photograph. In 3D animation elements are like objects that we see in real life and they have a front, back, top and bottom. You can see them from any angle.</p>
						<p> While the examples that we have referred to earlier were in the entertainment space, 2D and 3D animation studios, now days also cater a lot to the corporate sector. Businesses and corporations use the services of animations to
							educate,
							inform, make product demos, convey the meaning of tough concepts in an easy manner. By seeing the examples below, you would be in a better position to understand the difference between a 2D animated video and 3D Animated video used in
							the
							corporate sector.</p>
						<p> This is an example of an <strong> <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gGjsY2i_7w"> 2D animation</a></strong> used by a animation studio to explain it’s own service offerings.</p>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gGjsY2i_7w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


						<p>The following video informs the retailers about how to take care of a particular product by using <strong> <a  class="text-primary" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JkHxSpwvTB8">3D animation</a> </strong></p>

					<h3>	Example of 3D animation </h3>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JkHxSpwvTB8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


					<p>	The skillsets and software required to do 2D animation and 3D animation usually differ quite a lot.</p>
				<p>		While for making a 2D animation you usually require illustrators (to make the characters and back grounds), animators, scriptwriters, voice over artists and video editors.</p>
					<p>	For making a 3D animation you require modelers (people who are expert at designing the model and mostly rigging them), people who are good in texturing and shading, lighting, expert compositors, animators, scriptwriters, voice over
						artists and video editors.</p>
					<p>	As you can see from the list the process of 3D animation is normally much more complex as compared to 2D animation. Besides this 3D animation can also take a lot of time and expense in rendering the video as it requires very fast and high
						end computers to do this. You may even need to take the services of cloud based render farms that can give you a much lesser render time.</p>
					<p>	Here is a good article that takes you through the entire 3D animation process</p>
					<strong>	https://medium.com/@homicidalnacho/3d-modelling-pipeline-bd9be7dba136</strong>
					<p>	Besides 2D and 3D animation, animation styles also have sub -genres. Like 2D animation can be further broken into motion graphics and whiteboard animation.</p>
					<h3>	Motion Graphics Animation</h3>
					<p>	Motion graphics animation is a type of animation that in which we add motion to elements that otherwise may have been used for still graphics. This kind of animation is used quite a lot by the corporate world to showcase their products
						and services.</p>
						<p>This is the example of a motion Graphics animation, that talks about an information technology product</p>
						<p>Example of motion graphics video</p>

			<h3>			Whiteboard Animation</h3>

					<p>	Similarly white board animation refers to a style of animation in which usually illustrations are shown by drawing them on a white background. This animation style is also quite popular in the business world to showcase services,
						information and product details.</p>
					<p>	Below are a couple of examples of whiteboard animation used for storytelling and service description.</p>

					<h3>	Top animators in India</h3>
				<p>		So in a nut shell this is the story of animation and animation studios in India and around the world. But the story of animation in India cannot be completed without knowing about the pioneers who have taken Indian Animation studios to
						the top. If you would also like to know about the top animators in India, who are the soul behind the rise of animation in India, do see this video that contains details about these pioneers and stalwarts in the animation field.</p>
