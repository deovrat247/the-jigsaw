<h2>Factors influencing the cost of Ecommerce Photography in India </h2><br>				
						
<img src="<?php echo base_url();?>assets/images/influencing-factors-ecommerce-photography.jpg" alt="product photography in mumbai">


<p>The cost of e-commerce photography in India can vary depending on a number of factors, including the product type, the quantity of product photographs, the complexity of the shoot, the setting of the shoot, the photographer's level of experience and expertise, the location, and the length of the photoshoot. For your reference, the following are some factors: </p>

<p>1. Simple product photography involves taking pictures of specific products against a white or neutral background. Normally, each item costs between Rs. 200 and Rs. 500. </p>

<p>2. Product photography that is done in a natural setting or with models is referred to as lifestyle product photography. </p>

<p>2. 360-degree product photography entails using multiple images to produce a 360-degree view of the product. The price range in this case is estimated by seeing the complexity, size and the area to be covered in the 360-degree view. </p>

 <p>The cost of e-commerce photography in India can range from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5000 per product, depending on the difficulty of the shoot and the quantity of photos needed. Yet, the cost of some goods, such as jewellery, apparel, and electronics, can be higher. Some photographers might also provide package deals, where the cost of each item drops as the quantity of items rises. Extra services like post-processing and retouching may be extra for some photographers. Before making a decision, it is advised to get estimates from several photographers to evaluate prices and services. </p>
